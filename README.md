# Reinforcement Learning Projects

This repository contains implementations of various reinforcement learning (RL) models trained on different environments. The key environments used include:

- **CartPole-v1**
- **MineRL Treechop Task**

## Environment Setup

To get started with these projects, you can set up your Python environment using the following steps.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Musiemhy/Reinforcement-learning-training.git
    cd Reinforcement-learning-training
    ```

2.  Set up a Python virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv rl_env
    source rl_env/bin/activate # For Linux/macOS
    rl_env\Scripts\activate # For Windows
    ```

3.  Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  Running the Code:

    CartPole-v1 Task:

        ```bash
        cd CartPole_RL
        python train.py
        ```

    MineRL Task:

        ```bash
        cd MineRL_Task
        python train.py
        ```
